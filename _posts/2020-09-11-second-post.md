title: About Me
---

My name is Severin Newsom, going by Sev is no problem as well. I study Computer Science at Christopher Newport University. I transferred to the university from Thomas Nelson Community College, where I earned an Associate's Degree in Computer Science. Studying the Digital Humanites today represents a a _unique opportunity_ in time. The degree to which we have digitized our access and use of the humanities through various mediums is _stronger than ever_, and is always growing. 
I hope to learn more about this, and about the challenges therein, and how various projects in the field of Digital Humanites have shaped its growth. I predict that studying the required readings for the course, as well as lectures and other standard course materials can help _shape my writing ability_, something important in many contexts in the modern life.
I'd like to maybe find a company that would help me pursue a Master's when I'm ready, although I'm not sure how that might look.
Ever since I was tasked with using software in school to produce assignments I've thought about how literature, the arts, and communication is kept digitally, and how it is displayed digitally, and how those factors and structures can shape how we _view_ those contents. Different people have different biases towards different languages jsut as a matter of taste, and there's a striking similarity with how information is accessed affecting our conclusions. As humanity increases its co-habitation with the digital, our records and writings, recordings and resultant conceptions will be changed.
