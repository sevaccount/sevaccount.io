In our modern world, it seems hardly a day may go by without our being subject to a persuasive argument from some other person. This is often the case when we discover a new topic or source of information. From normal daily speech to the rhetoric of politicians, opinions abound. With the advent of thought-provoking art and compelling literature, many voices expressing themselves, it may seem something of an inevitability that the critic would appear in response, as a kind of reactionary voice trying to make sense of what it encounters.
In 1929, at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 15 modest statues were given in assorted categories at the first Academy Awards ceremony. Not broadcast on radio or television, the ceremony lasted about 15 minutes, with winners having been announced months in advance. Since then the ceremony has grown to have become a minor global phenomenon, with its own share of curious controversies and a generous supply of water cooler conversation topics.
When one wins a prized accolade, what then? The occasion calls for a speech. An opportunity to be humble, or to boast, to give thanks to many, or bring attention to the hard work of one's colleagues. Included among reasons for recipiency is the coveted Best Original Screenplay. The screenplay describes the direction of the film, as well as supplying dialogue. A screenplay deemed fine art among a community of critics no doubt reflects well on the skill of a screenwriter. My project looks at the speeches given by those who have been honored for their writing prowess and combs through their acceptance speeches to see if their speeches similarly impress.
Research on this project has so far proven promising. A database containing full transcripts for the Academy Awards acceptance speeches is available on the Academy's site. And crucially, the speeches are not all simple thanks and a smile, but also have plenty of material to give this project life. When I had begun this project, I was at an impasse. Searching through many carefully constructed and well-thought-out projects made it seem like it had all already been done. I had a small breakthrough when I discovered that the speeches of the U.S. President were public domain, and it set my mind thinking about the relationships among our words. I had an idea to show associations in words, so that if you wanted to investigate a keyword, you would be able to see other words associated with that word's use. Investigating this, I found the amount of material prohibitive for the scope of this project, but looking about the humanities and art criticism, I found a new topic for the focus of this project. Looking among other DH projects, I saw some alternatives to my approach, including natural language processing, and linguistic mapping tools, to help analyze the gist and intent behind speakers, but the generally short nature of the acceptance speeches is something that suits more simple analysis well. I've found tools that don't require any programming, and that aspect of the project is something I'm continuing to tool.
