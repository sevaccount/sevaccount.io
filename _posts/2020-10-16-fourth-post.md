Recently I used XML for the first time. I was assigned column 1 on page 655 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper.” In this project, I used TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), a standardization of XML (eXtensible Markup Language). Part of this process involved using a software called Oxygen, which reminds me of using an IDE when coding. This marked my first exposure to this technology. Ahead I'll be reflecting on the process.

Firstly, I had access to the text In Google Docs. There, my professor had posted the text I would markup. I scanned it, and the plan was to apply markup to the Google Doc. This was done using comments, so as to not clutter up the text, and make sure I was able to get the tags in the correct places without making changes to the text, whether in formatting or accidently making edits. Here, I supplied tags, indicating paragraphs, emdashes, and more. The task was simple enough at this stage, most of my tags were paragraph tags. Google Docs was a sufficient warmup to doing the markup in Oxygen. 

Oxygen helped let me know whether my TEI was acceptable. The interface really is similar to an IDE. I enjoyed how logical the layout is, with each section being clearly distinct in its purpose and use. For example, the TEI code is seperate from the Header. The system of tags and their associated indentations is pleasant to the eye. The software was intuitive and didn’t present additional obstacles. I feel confident that if I need to use Oxygen again in the future I’ve got a nice bit of exposure to help with that. Maybe if I do markup I’ll take a look at what the ecosystem of available software options looks like at that point, but it’s likely I’ll gravitate toward using Oxygen further.

The text being a short story, the author used a series of symbols to indicate a timeskip. I was uncertain about the direction to take implementing this, but Dr. Stover explained that it would reside in <p> tags, which was straightforward enough. The <p> tags are used heavily in the markup process, so making sure to not miss any is crucial to the process.

This project allowed me to become exposed to using TEI for document encoding. Oxygen seems like a worthwhile software, and wouldn't be remiss to hear I was expected to use it again at a later date. I would encourage others who might use Oxygen to give it a go. My experience applying markup to literature has been valuable.
