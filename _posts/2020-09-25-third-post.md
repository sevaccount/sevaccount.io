All roads lead to Rome. ORBIS is an interactive model of the road system and trade routes in ancient Rome. A Digital Humanities Grant from Stanford University funded the project. The Roman Empire covered a huge part of the globe at its height. The Roman empire covered one-ninth of the earth's circumference. Its territory reached into three continents. In those days, the spread of people meant the spread of ideas. This project gives a glimpse of life in the past through how travel functioned in those days. 

ORBIS has three models representing road, river, and sea routes, as well have five ferry routes. The project uses ‘nodes’ to represent travel destinations. The bulk of these are urban settlements. ORBIS uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to make its maps. This factors for cost of travel, duration of travel, and distance between nodes. The model uses 632 sites on its maps and covers more than 10 million square kilometers. ORBIS uses hundreds of sea routes in the pathfinding. Wave height determines sea travel, with fourteen different types of road travel implemented. Much like today, the largest prohibitor in travel was cost. ORBIS displays three options for travel priority. These are the cheapest route, the  fastest, and the shortest, or the route that covers the least ground. The project shows that the shortest distance between two nodes could be a route too costly for most. It may not even be the quickest route.

Road, river, and sea routes show the flow of goods. A drop-down menu is available to show how long a journey would take. These options change depending on method of travel. Travelling by foot is much slower than traveling by horse, after all. 

ORBIS brings to light the challenges of the time, with a satisfying amount of detail. The project is easy to interact with. It is a challenge to appreciate that the simple lines represent personal histories. Having icons that change depending on selected travel might help make it come to life. More use of historical imagery would help bring humanity to the project. 

The historical authenticity of the project adds to its character. ORBIS uses Denarii, the currency of the day, to represent cost in money. The project displays cities with the name they had at the time. For example, Roma, instead of Rome. ORBIS demonstrates prices for the passengers and their goods. The time of year having a huge impact on the travel time also adds to the character of the project. ORBIS teaches us that in both transportation and communication, price matters.
